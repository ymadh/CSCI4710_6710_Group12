    For our group project, we designed and developed an interactive web
    application that allows a user to rent and return scooters around his or her
    college campus. It is intended to help track available scooters across
    campus and help the user keep track of his or her history of rentals. The
    system works by first allowing the user to make an account, then granting
    the user access to scooter information such as type and location. Only one
    scooter may be rented by one user at any given time, and the user must
    return the scooter before the system will allow the user to rent another.<br /><br />
    The system uses Flask and SQLite, and securely stores the user's password in
    the database we have created. We hope you enjoy the site and find it useful!
